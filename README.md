# Memory Game Project

## NOTE

This is a work done in JavaScript to emulate a memory game in browser. I have completed this work as part of the UDACITY NANODEGREE IN PROGRAMMING.
A starter package was provided by UDACITY, but all JS code has been developed indipendently.

## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

## Contributing

This repository is the starter code for _all_ Udacity students. Therefore, we most likely will not accept pull requests.
